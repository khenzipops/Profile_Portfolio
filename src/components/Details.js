        I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)
        in 2021-2022. I was employed as a teacher from 2022 to 2024 at SHS Liceo
        de Cagayan University. During this time, I nurtured my passion for
        technology and set my sights on pursuing my dream of creating websites
        and engaging in tech-related work. With a strong passion for technology
        and problem-solving, I continually strive to expand my knowledge in
        software development and networking. I am focused on improving my coding
        skills and IT systems expertise, and my goal is to apply my knowledge in
        real-world projects, contributing to innovative tech solutions that make
        a meaningful impact solutions.
